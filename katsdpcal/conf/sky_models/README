Description strings for sources in the sky model

Description strings have 5 comma-separated fields with format:
name list, tags, longitudinal, latitudinal, flux model

An example description string is:
name1 | *name 2, radec cal, 12:34:56.7, -04:34:34.2, (1000.0 2000.0 1.0)

Flux models can be provided in two formats, one is the 
Baars polynomial format used by katpoint (see katpoint documentation for further details).
The second format is similar to the wsclean format (see https://sourceforge.net/p/wsclean/wiki/ComponentList/).

The wsclean component is space separated (not comma separated) and  prefaced by the
minimum and maximum frequency of the model (in MHz) and a string `wsclean` indicating the type of model to be used.
An example model is :
855 1712 wsclean 15.0 [-1.5 -9.1] false 1200000.0
